      <p><strong>Welcome to KM Tech Solution. Here we will provide you easiest way to manage your LinkedIn profile and do post and many more.</strong></p>
      <p>Today in the hiQ legal proceeding, the Court announced a significant win for LinkedIn and our members against personal data scraping, among other platform abuses. The Court ruled that LinkedIn’s User Agreement unambiguously prohibits scraping and the unauthorized use of scraped data as well as fake accounts, affirming LinkedIn’s legal positions against hiQ for the past six years. The Court also found that hiQ knew for years that its actions violated our User Agreement, and that LinkedIn is entitled to move forward with its claim that hiQ violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.</p>
      <p>The Court’s ruling helps us better protect everyone in our professional community from unauthorized use of profile data, and it establishes important precedent to stop this kind of abuse in the future. We will continue to fight on behalf of our members to stop illegal scraping. From taking legal action against unauthorized scraping to making significant investments in technical defenses, we are committed to keeping the control of data where it belongs - with our members.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0rem;margin: 0;">I have the pleasure of hearing from you and members across LinkedIn how much value you get from our professional community we’re building. Equally important, is that in order for you to find that next job, learn new skills, or connect with others, you want to feel confident that the people you come across are authentic.</p>

         Introducing “About this profile”
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>We’re adding a new “About this profile” feature that will show you when a profile was created and last updated, along with whether the member has verified a phone number and/or work email associated with their account. We hope that viewing this information will help you make informed decisions, such as when you are deciding whether to accept a connection request or reply to a message.</p>
      <p>Starting this week, you can find the "About this profile" feature on each LinkedIn member's profile page, and soon you'll see it in more places over the coming weeks, including when viewing invitations and messages. For work emails, our plan is to start with a limited number of companies, but you can expect to see this expand as we add additional companies over time.</p>
